"""Generate .pyi type stubs for the pyoomph._core extension module.

This reproduces what the old top-level build script did with
`pybind11-stubgen` + `src/nanobind/patch_stubs.py`, but is invoked as a
POST_BUILD step on the `_core` CMake target so it happens automatically as
part of `./configure && make` / `pip install .` via scikit-build-core.
Since the switch to nanobind, stub generation uses nanobind's own bundled
`python -m nanobind.stubgen` (always available - nanobind is a hard build
dependency, unlike the old optional `pybind11-stubgen`).

The stub is REQUIRED, not a convenience. It is what gives editors and type
checkers the API of the compiled extension, and the wheel also ships
`py.typed`, which tells them the information is there - a wheel without the
stub therefore promises typing and delivers an unintrospectable binary,
i.e. no completion at all rather than obviously none.

This script used to exit 0 unconditionally, on the reasoning that stubs are
a developer convenience and must never break a wheel build. That is exactly
how the Windows wheel shipped without a `.pyi` for as long as it did: the
extension failed to import under `nanobind.stubgen` (see
`cmake/stubgen_launcher.py`), the failure was printed and swallowed, and the
build stayed green. With `--required` (which CMake passes unless
PYOOMPH_MUMPS_REQUIRE_STUBS=OFF) any failure to produce the stub is fatal, so the
next such breakage stops the build that would have shipped it.

Usage (called from CMakeLists.txt):
    generate_stubs.py --module-dir DIR --module-name _core \
        --stage-dir DIR [--extra-copy-dir DIR] [--patch-script PATH] [--python EXE]

On success, `<stage-dir>` ends up containing either:
  - `<module-name>.pyi`               (flat module, the common case), or
  - `<module-name>/__init__.pyi` (+.pyi siblings) (module with submodules)
so that `install(DIRECTORY "<stage-dir>/" DESTINATION pyoomph OPTIONAL)`
in CMakeLists.txt can drop it straight next to the built extension.

`--extra-copy-dir` additionally mirrors the same stub into a second
location - normally the source-tree `pyoomph/` package directory - so that
static analyzers (Pylance/Pyright/mypy) editing the checked-out source can
resolve `pyoomph._core` even without a full `pip install`, since they never
see the build/install directory.
